## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Advanced Gameplay Mechanics**: Incorporates essential features like **steal and delay prevention**, plus the popular **"keep direction"** feature from Dodgeball Redux.
* **Dual Homing Modes**: Choose between two distinct rocket behaviors: a modern, smooth `"homing"` and a classic, more direct `"legacy homing"`.
* **Extensive Rocket Customization**: Define rocket classes with unique models, sounds, speeds, turn rates, and damage properties via configuration files.
* **Rich Event System**: Use parameters like `@rocket`, `@owner`, and `@target` to trigger custom server commands on in-game events.
* **Modular System**: A powerful core plugin with a suite of optional modules allows you to enable only the features you want.
* **Developer API**: A robust set of natives and forwards allows other developers to easily create addons that interact with the gamemode.
